- MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- RESTful APIs, Authentication
- Git & GitHub, Deployment (Netlify, Vercel, Heroku)

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a project or module from the course. You’ll find a README inside most folders explaining the project, how to run it, and the core concepts it covers.
